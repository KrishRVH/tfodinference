# Agent Guide

Read `CONTEXT.md` first if it exists. Then read relevant ADRs/docs before
changing architecture or domain language. Use this file for agent working rules.

## Principles

- Complexity is the enemy. Prefer obvious code, local state, and direct data
  flow over clever abstractions.
- Say no to abstractions, frameworks, services, config layers, and docs that do
  not remove real complexity.
- Respect Chesterton fences. Understand why code exists before deleting or
  replacing it.
- Keep one source of truth. Do not create doc twins for executable config.
- Add structure after the shape is visible. Small duplication beats premature
  indirection.
- Optimize only with evidence from real profiles or failing user experience.

## Commands

Everything a developer does goes through mise.

- `mise run tasks`: list available tasks.
- `mise run install`: install pinned tools/dependencies.
- `mise run fmt`: format.
- `mise run fmt:check`: verify formatting.
- `mise run lint`: lint/static analysis.
- `mise run test`: tests.
- `mise run standards`: local autofix workflow before `standards:check`.
- `mise run standards:check`: full CI gate.
- `mise run secrets`: scan the working tree for secrets.
- `mise run sbom`: generate a CycloneDX JSON SBOM under `sbom/`.
- `mise run dagger:standards:check`: optional isolated CI gate when Dagger is
  configured.

Do not call package managers, compilers, test runners, or Dagger directly
unless you are fixing the mise task itself. Dagger is invoked through mise only
when the project keeps the optional Dagger task fragment.

## Editing

- Make the smallest coherent change that solves the task.
- Follow existing language/tool config instead of restating it here.
- Keep strict type modes and static analysis passing.
- Prefer boring modules with clear inputs/outputs.
- Avoid global state, hidden I/O, and action at a distance.
- Put code near the thing it affects when that improves readability.
- Do not hand-edit generated files.
- Do not commit secrets. Use local env files for machine-specific values.

## Generated Output

Treat these as generated unless the task is specifically about them:

- dependency dirs: `node_modules/`, `vendor/`
- build/cache dirs: `build/`, `dist/`, `out/`, `coverage/`, `.cache/`
- release output: `sbom/`
- framework/tool dirs: `.next/`, `.nuxt/`, `.turbo/`, `.vite/`, `.svelte-kit/`
- language outputs: `target/`, `bin/Debug/`, `bin/Release/`, `obj/`,
  `.gradle/`, `.kotlin/`, `_build/`, `deps/`, `dist-newstyle/`,
  `.stack-work/`, `.zig-cache/`, `zig-cache/`, `zig-out/`, `zig-pkg/`
- tool caches: `.phpunit.cache/`, `.phpstan.cache/`, `.rector-cache/`,
  `.lua-language-server/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `.elixir_ls/`

If generated output is stale, fix the generator or mise task and regenerate.

## Context Hygiene

- Use `rg`/targeted reads before opening large trees.
- Do not read vendored, generated, minified, lock, corpus, or asset files
  wholesale unless their contents are the task.
- Prefer catalogs, schemas, tests, and public interfaces for orientation.

## Testing

- For bugs, reproduce with a failing regression test before fixing when
  practical.
- Prefer stable behavior/integration tests around real cut points.
- Keep E2E coverage small, important, and reliable.
- Do not chase coverage numbers for their own sake.
- Before handoff, run `mise run standards:check` unless blocked; report any skipped
  verification and why.

## Git

- Do not revert user changes unless explicitly asked.
- Keep generated and local-only files out of commits.
- Follow Conventional Commits standards for all git commit messages.
